# Explanation of data
The data of this experiment is yoked to registered report investigating the effect of novelty (using iVR for the first time) on word learning. More information on this project can be found https://osf.io/y72ew/ and https://github.com/JAQuent/noveltyVR. This means there were three groups that have different amount of data. Group 1 (novelty group) has only data on day 2, group 2 (control group) has data on day 1 & on day 2 and group 3 (already did VR group), which also did only day 2. Participants in group 2 complete the same task with object at the same locations twice we therefore only analysed data from day 1.
