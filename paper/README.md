This README provides a quick overview of what is to be found in this folder.

Â 
# Files
- ***paper.Rproj***  R project file. 
- ***result_section.X*** to ***result_section5.X*** are the .Rmd and .html files that contain the results of the analyses.
- ***set_analysis.Rmd*** illustrates some exploratory (uncommented) analysis of the question whether the U-shape differs as a function of set. 

# Folders and their content

- ***background_work*** contains the data from the normative study. For more information and code see https://github.com/JAQuent/ratingStudy. 
	- ***analyse_pooled_data_rik.R*** A script to quickly analyse the pooled results across all experiments. Currently set-up to compare results from Exp 1 and Exp 4 (Exp 3b in text). Sequential and pooled analysis is compared here. 
	- ***does_sequential_order_matter.R*** Undocumented script with generated data comparing pooled and sequential approach of analysing data. 
	- ***explain_why_linear_correlation_can_be_u_shape***

	- ***kitchen_bias.R*** Calculates how much kitchen objects are biased to be at extreme positions. 
	- ***normativeStudy_age.R*** Calculates the demographics for the normative study. 
	- ***not_seen_analysis.R*** Calculates how many objects on average were reported as not seen for each experiment. 
	- ***pooled_vs_sequential.png*** Comparing pooled vs. sequential analysis of data with ***sequential_vs_pooled_gridAnalysis.R***. 
	- ***posthoc_set_analysis.docx*** Word document for comprehensive analysis and thoughts about the effect of set on the U-shape. 
	- ***posthoc_set_analysis.Rmd*** .Rmd document for comprehensive analysis and thoughts about the effect of set on the U-shape. 
	- ***scaled_and_non_scaled_breaking_points.txt*** Saved object/location expectancy values for the non-scaled breaking points. 
	- ***sensitivityAnalysis***

	- ***sequential_vs_pooled_gridAnalysis.R*** Script to create ***pooled_vs_sequential.png***. 
- ***figures*** contains image files for the figures for Chapter 2 from my thesis and the paper version.
