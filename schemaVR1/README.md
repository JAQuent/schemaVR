Description of this repository
==============================

The aim of this experiment was an attempt to show a U-shaped function that was demonstrated by Greve et al. (2018) can also be observed in paradigm that is more closely related to real-world episodic memory. Therefore, we ran an immersive VR study where participants encoded twelve kitchen and eight non-kitchen objects in a virtual kitchen. After a short distractor task, particpants completed a 3D location recall task in VR, where they were asked to place the objects in the location, in which they were during encoding. This was followed by a 3AFC task, where the correct location had to be chosen out of three alternatives. At the end of the experiment, participants rated how expected the object were in their locations and whether the object was expected in general to be found in a kitchen.

Note that this repository unfortunately has not been version controlled from the beginning and that some files for altred to fit into the newly developed open notebook/repository scheme. This is actually the first repository, for which the new system is implemented.
