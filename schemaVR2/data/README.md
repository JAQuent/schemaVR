- dropDownTime - Time (in seconds) the object was dropped down in relation to starting the scene in unity.
- respTime - Time (in seconds) the participant needed to respond (i.e. picking the object up) from start of trial. 
- answerTime - Time (in seconds) the participant needed to give answer (i.e. dropping the object) from the time the object of picked up.

- yPositionCorrect - Y position (in virtual metres), where the object actually was.
- zPositionCorrect - Z position (in virtual metres), where the object actually was.
- euclideanDist - Euclidean distance (in virtual metres) between point, where the object was placed and where the object actually was. 
- targetLocation - Number of the location, where the object actually was (i.e. target location).
- targetRankPre - Average rank from normative dataset for the object/location ratings for the target (0 to 400).
- foil1Location - Number of the location of foil 1 in 3AFC task.
- foil1RankPre - Average rank from normative dataset for the object/location ratings for foil 1 (0 to 400)
- foil2Location - Number of the location of foil 2 in 3AFC task.
- foil2RankPre - Average rank from normative dataset for the object/location ratings for foil 2 (0 to 400).
- AFCPreTime - Presentation time (in milliseconds) of the three images in the 3AFC task.
- rtAFC - Reaction time (in milliseconds) to make 3AFC decision. 
- resAFC - Response given for 3AFC decision (1, 2 or 3).
- accAFC - Accuracy of 3AFC response (0 = incorrect, 1 = correct).
- conPreTime -  Presentation time (in milliseconds) of confidence display in the 3AFC task.

- left - Number of the location (i.e. image) that was displayed on the left side of the screen.
- middle - Number of the location (i.e. image) that was displayed in the middle of the screen.
- right - Number of the location (i.e. image) that was displayed on the right side of the screen.
- afcTrial - Trial number during 3AFC task.
- objLocTargetRating - Object/location expectancy rating (unexpected/-100 to expected/100) by the participant for object in target location.
- objLocFoil1Rating - Object/location expectancy rating (unexpected/-100 to expected/100) by the participant for object in target foil 1 location.
- objLocFoil2Rating - Object/location expectancy rating (unexpected/-100 to expected/100) by the participant for object in target foil 2 location.

- generalRatingNorm - Average general expectancy rating (unexpected/-100 to expected/100) from normative dataset for object.
- generalExpectancyFactor - Categorical variable (expected in kitchen (object 1 to 12) and unexpected in kitchen (object 13 to 20)).
- loc1 to loc20 - Average object/location rating (unexpected/-100 to expected/100) for object in location 1 to 20 from normative dataset.
- accRecall - Accuracy of recall (0 = incorrect, 1 = correct). This is calculated by finding the closest spawnPoint and then checking whether it was the correct one. 
- closestLoc - Location with the shortest Euclidean distance for the point, where the object was placed. 
- next2Loc to next20Loc Second to twentieth closest location (based on Euclidean distance). 
- expectedInKitchen - Same as generalExpectancyFactor but with different labels.
